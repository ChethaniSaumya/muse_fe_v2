                                Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), also referred to as "Song Tokens," are unique digital assets created and issued on the MuseCoinX Platform, representing fractional and transferable ownership shares in the royalty income derived from the use, distribution, or performance of a particular song. Each NFT is created using blockchain technology, specifically the Polygon blockchain, ensuring the transparency, security, and immutability of all transactions. The ownership of such Song Tokens entitles the holder to a proportionate share of the Royalty Income generated from the use, distribution, or streaming of the song on digital music platforms such as Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube, and other similar platforms. Song Tokens are transferable, meaning that ownership can be bought, sold, or otherwise transferred between parties, subject to the conditions set forth herein.
                              </p>

                                The MuseCoinX Platform refers to the blockchain-based decentralized service ecosystem created and operated by PHYDIGI LIMITED, a company incorporated under the laws of the United Kingdom. The Platform facilitates the tokenization of Royalty Income and the issuance of Song Tokens as outlined in these Terms. The Platform includes, but is not limited to, the website, mobile applications, decentralized applications (dApps), application programming interfaces (APIs), and smart contracts, which together enable Artists to tokenize their royalty rights and distribute fractional ownership of these rights to Fans via Song Tokens. The Platform may be accessed through the official website at www.musecoinx.com and is available on any supported device with internet access. The Platform operates in a decentralized and non-custodial manner, ensuring that the control over tokens and funds remains with the users.

                                An "Artist" is an individual, band, or Music Label who owns or controls the rights to musical works and who uploads and tokenizes their music on the MuseCoinX Platform. By uploading their musical works, the Artist grants the Platform a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, and sublicensable license to tokenize the royalty rights of the uploaded music into Song Tokens, which can then be distributed or purchased by Fans. Artists are responsible for ensuring they have all necessary rights, including copyright and licensing, to upload the music and tokenize the royalty rights. Artists retain full ownership and control over their underlying musical works but grant MuseCoinX the license to use the song for the purpose of creating and issuing Song Tokens, which are linked to the income generated by the song.

                                A "Fan" or "NFT Holder" refers to an individual or entity who acquires, holds, or purchases Song Tokens via the MuseCoinX Platform. The purchase or holding of Song Tokens entitles the Fan to a share of the Royalty Income generated by the corresponding song, proportional to the amount of Song Tokens they hold. The holder of the Song Token does not acquire ownership of the song itself, but rather a share in the royalties earned from its distribution and use across digital platforms. The rights and obligations associated with owning Song Tokens are governed by the terms set forth in these ToR. Fans also have the right to resell, transfer, or trade Song Tokens on compatible platforms, subject to applicable laws and the terms outlined in these ToR.

                                Muse Coins are the native digital currency of the MuseCoinX Platform, which serve as the primary medium of exchange within the Platform. Muse Coins are used for transactions such as purchasing Song Tokens, distributing royalties to NFT Holders, and facilitating other economic activities within the MuseCoinX ecosystem. Muse Coins may also be used to pay for any associated fees or services on the Platform. The exchange rate and value of Muse Coins are determined by market conditions, demand, and the use of the Platform. Muse Coins are recorded and managed on the Polygon blockchain, ensuring transparency and security.

                                External Wallet Providers refer to independent, third-party services that are utilized by Fans to store, manage, and transfer their Song Tokens. These wallet services are not operated or controlled by MuseCoinX. As such, MuseCoinX does not have access to or responsibility for the security or management of any user wallets. Users are solely responsible for securing their wallets and any Song Tokens stored within them. The MuseCoinX Platform operates on a non-custodial basis, meaning that MuseCoinX does not take possession of any Song Tokens or associated funds, which remain under the control of the user's chosen wallet provider.

                                Royalty Income refers to the payments made to Artists or Music Labels by digital streaming platforms, such as Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube, and other similar services, for the public performance, distribution, or use of their songs. The Royalty Income generated from these platforms is then shared with Fans who hold Song Tokens corresponding to the specific song. The Royalty Income is distributed proportionally to the NFT holders, based on their ownership percentage of Song Tokens. This income is subject to fluctuations based on the performance of the song on these platforms and other market conditions. MuseCoinX facilitates the distribution of this Royalty Income but does not guarantee the amount of income or the success of any particular song. Regarding performance royalties, MuseCoinX relies on the Artist's declaration and the terms outlined in the contract with the Artist. We expect the Artist to accurately report and declare performance royalties from public performances.

These tokens are available for purchase by Fans or, alternatively, can be transferred to Fans via airdrop. Each Song Token represents a proportional share of the Royalty Income generated by the song through public performance, distribution, and usage on digital streaming platforms.

The payments will be made in Muse Coins, the native token of the MuseCoinX Platform, which can also be used within the Platform for other transactions. The royalty payments are executed via smart contracts, ensuring that payouts are transparent, timely, and proportionate to the ownership of the Song Tokens.
